Now *that‚Äôs* a bold and fascinating challenge. Recreating something like **radare2** in Lua is ambitious‚Äîbut totally possible in a modular, focused way. This project is already well underway, with several core components implemented and extensible design in mind.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

Based on the current `src`, `plugins`, and `docs` folders, the following features are implemented:

- **Binary Loader**
  - Supports ELF, PE (Windows), and Mach-O format detection and parsing (see `src/core/loader.lua` and format modules).
- **Hex Viewer**
  - Classic hex dump with offset, hex, and ASCII (see `src/core/hexview.lua`).
- **Disassembler**
  - Uses Capstone via LuaJIT FFI for x86_64 (see `src/core/disasm.lua`).
- **Command Shell**
  - Modular CLI commands: `disasm`, `hex`, `load`, `help` (see `src/commands/`).
- **Documentation**
  - Docs for all major modules and commands (`docs/` folder).
- **PE (Windows) Support**
- **Plugin/Modular Command Structure**
  - Easy to add new commands and formats.

## üìù Remaining Tasks

From the `todo.md` and project plan, here are the next steps:

- [ ] Add test cases for each method.
- [ ] Add dynamic analysis tools such as debuggers.
- [ ] Create a minimal sandbox environment to test malware.
- [ ] Implement APK (Android) support (listed as completed, but not present in code).
- [ ] Expand analysis engine (function/string/code/data detection, CFG, etc.).
- [ ] Scripting interface for user automation.
- [ ] Visualization tools (ASCII graphs, DOT export, etc.).

## üß© Core Components Overview

1. **Binary Loader**  
   Reads ELF, PE, and Mach-O binaries. Parses headers, sections, and symbols.

2. **Hex Viewer**  
   Dumps memory in hex + ASCII, supports offset and range.

3. **Disassembler**  
   Capstone-powered, currently x86_64, extensible for other architectures.

4. **Analysis Engine**  
   Placeholder for function/string/code/data analysis and control flow graph.

5. **Command Shell**  
   CLI with modular commands (`disasm`, `hex`, `load`, etc.).

6. **Documentation**  
   All modules and commands are documented in the `docs/` folder.

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Add automated tests for all modules.
- Implement dynamic analysis and sandboxing.
- Expand analysis and scripting capabilities.
- Add visualization features.

Let‚Äôs keep building this modular, scriptable, and extensible Lua sandbox and reverse engineering malware analysis  toolkit!
